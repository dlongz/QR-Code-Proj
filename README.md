## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

I had a lot of fun using CSS even though it doesn't act like you want it from time to time...ugh. I do love Flexbox though. It definitely makes things a bit easier. I was able to get the colors and the shape pretty much as close to the Figma file as possible.

Something interesting was the new(maybe new) way of applying the Google vairable Fonts. It took me a little bit to get used to but it was simple enough.

```css
.outfit-bold {
	font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
	font-optical-sizing: auto;
	font-weight: 700;
	font-style: normal;
}

.outfit-regular {
	font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
	font-optical-sizing: auto;
	font-weight: 400;
	font-style: normal;
}
```
